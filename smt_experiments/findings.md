# Findings

## n_dims_experiment (old)
- Membership test time looks to be relatively constant with CanonicalHyperCubeSet, 
and linearly increasing with Z3ProductSet with the number of cubes.
- Z3ProductSet is slower than CanonicalHyperCube in almost all cases, except for 
when the number of dimensions is greater than 12, and the number of cubes increases exponentially.
Even in this case, creating the CanonicalHyperCube takes most of the time, and membership test is faster
with CanonicalHyperCube than with Z3ProductSet.
- Creation time seems to be linear with the number of cubes with Z3ProductSet.
