## n_dims_experiment (old)

- Membership test time looks to be relatively constant with CanonicalHyperCubeSet, 
and linearly increasing with Z3ProductSet with the number of cubes.
- Z3ProductSet is slower than CanonicalHyperCube in almost all cases, except for 
when the number of dimensions is greater than 12, and the number of cubes increases exponentially.
Even in this case, creating the CanonicalHyperCube takes most of the time, and membership test is faster
with CanonicalHyperCube than with Z3ProductSet.
- Creation time seems to be linear with the number of cubes with Z3ProductSet.

### Creation Time

- With all the different values of n_dims, there is a point where the creation time of 
CanonicalHyperCubeSet is greater than the creation time of Z3ProductSet. 
For n_dims=5 it is around 70 cubes, for n_dims=10 it is around 60 and for 
n_dims=15 it is around 50.
- It seems that the increase trend for CanonicalHyperCubeSet is super-linear
(not sure that it is exponential, but it is not a straight line).
- The increase rate for Z3ProductSet seems to be linear, as expected.
- The difference between the two implementations gets larger as n_cubes 
and n_dims increases. For n_dims=15 and n_cubes=15, 
Z3ProductSet creation time is less than 0.5 and CanonicalHyperCubeSet is around 2.
- This makes sense since most of the processing in CanonicalHyperCubeSet is done
in creation, where most of the processing in Z3ProductSet is done when checking.
