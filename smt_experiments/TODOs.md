- [x] create a scatter plot comparing time for element containment over the 
number of intervals, comparing z3 and our implementation
- [x] create a scatter plot comparing time for element containment over 
the number of dimensions (single intervals) comparing z3 and our implementation.
- [ ] compare different types of actions over different number of dimensions. (not only element containment)
- [ ] compare z3 bit vectors and integer performance.
