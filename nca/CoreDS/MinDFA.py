# TODO: consider adding abstract base class for MinDFA and CanonicalIntervalSet , with common api

class MinDFA:
    """
    MinDFA is a wrapper class for greenery.fsm , to support the api required for dimensions in hypercube-set
    (similar to CanonicalIntervalSet)
    It holds an fsm object of type greenery.fsm, and has the following additional members:
    - is_all_words: flag (ternary-logic) to indicate if it is known for this DFA if its language is all words or not.
    - complement_dfa: either None (if complement dfa is unknown) or another MinDFA object which complements this
                      dfa to all words.

    Assumptions:
    (1) assuming that all MinDFA objects are originated from dfa_from_regex(), or dfa_from_fsm() on fsm that
        is originated from MinDFA (or operations between two fsms originated from MinDFA)
    (2) Based on (1), assuming that two MinDFA objects are equal iff they have the exact same set of states
       (including states numbers), same initial state, same final states, and same transition relation.
       This is because in greenery.fsm, the fsm construction is deterministic (see fsm.crawl() )

    (3) thus, for performance considerations, overriding the __eq__ method, and adding the __hash__ function.
        MinDFA comparison is more lightweight this way , rather than using fsm.equivalent() method.

    (4) assuming that any comparison or other operations between two MinDFA objects, are for DFAs of the same
       alphabet.
      In MinDFA __eq__ and __hash__ ignoring the alphabet: for performance considerations, allowing to build MinDFA with
      a minimal relevant alphabet (e.g. alphabet for "PUT" is {P,U,T,everything_else})
      * for a DFA originated from finite-len language of regexp, the alphabet will be restricted to the words' alphabet.
      * for a DFA of an infinite language, it will necessarily have the original alphabet.
        that is because, in istio, regexp with * is always translated to: [any allowed char]*
        and relevant also for the complement case, since we subtract from (dfa_all_words).
      * assuming that no finite-len DFA MinDFA any char that is illegal in the original alphabet.(legal input only)

    (5) assuming that all operations between MinDFA objects are with respect to a common dimension
        (no mix of MinDFA objects from different dimensions context)
