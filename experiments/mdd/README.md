## Ideas
- I think that after I have some basic implementation, I might find useful optimization ideas
for that if I check out papers, I will bookmark things that I see
- Reduced BDD:
  - Dealing with dont-cares (eliminate nodes whose children are isomorphic)
  - merging isomorphic sub-graphs
  - MDD is an extension to BDD with the branching parameter being some other number, BDD.
  - Edge-Valued MultiValued Decision Diagram (EVMDD) - MDD with costs on the edges.
  - Algebric Decision Diagram - output might not be binary, inputs are.

## TODO:
- [ ] try including skipping don't-cares -- how to include that into the hyper cube set
- [ ]
