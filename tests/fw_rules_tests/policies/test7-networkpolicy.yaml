### Second policy
### The policy defines traffic within the namespace kube-system-new.
### The possible app in the namespace are ibm-file-plugin, ibm-keepalived-watcher, ibm-kube-fluentd, ibm-storage-watcher, helm and vpn
### The policy allows traffic within namespace kube-system-new only from pods in the namespace and with app notin {ibm-file-plugin, ibm-keepalived-watcher}
###   this implementation is wrong w.r.t. specification since traffic will also be allowed from pods in which app is not defined
