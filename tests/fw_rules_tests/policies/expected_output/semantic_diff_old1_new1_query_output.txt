new1 and old1 are not semantically equivalent.

Added connections between persistent peers (based on topology from config: old1) :
src_ns: [demo] src_pods: [bank-ui] dst_ns: [demo] dst_pods: [account-command] conn: All but {protocols:TCP,dst_ports:8080,9090},{protocols:UDP,dst_ports:8080}

Removed connections between persistent peers (based on topology from config: new1) :
src_ns: [demo] src_pods: [account-query] dst_ns: [demo] dst_pods: [bank-ui] conn: All but {protocols:TCP,dst_ports:8080}
