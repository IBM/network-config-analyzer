new1a and old1 are not semantically equivalent.
Changed connections between persistent peers:
Added connections (based on topology from config: old1) :
src_ns: [demo] src_pods: [account-query] dst_ns: [demo] dst_pods: [bank-ui] conn: TCP 8080
src_ns: [demo] src_pods: [bank-ui] dst_ns: [demo] dst_pods: [account-command] conn: All connections

Removed connections (based on topology from config: new1a) :
src_ns: [demo] src_pods: [account-query] dst_ns: [demo] dst_pods: [bank-ui] conn: UDP 8080
