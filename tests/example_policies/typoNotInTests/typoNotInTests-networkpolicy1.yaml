### Demonstrates the risk that can be result from a small typo: if in notIn there is a typo in the key, all pods will be selected
### The following example contains two policies for defining ingress rules into kube-system. 
### The first one has a typo as result of which all ingress traffic into the namespace will be enabled; thus the second is redundant

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: ingress-with-typo-notin
  namespace: kube-system 
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
    - from:
      - podSelector:
          matchExpressions: 
            - key: app
              operator: NotIn
              values:
                - helmm


###  Enables ingress from namespace default; this will be redundant since the above policy enables all ingress by mistake
