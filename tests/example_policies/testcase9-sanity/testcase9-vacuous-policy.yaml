### This network policy demonstrates the ability of our sanity checks to detect real life problems.
### The first policy contains a simple label mistake - the use of app label instead of k8s-app label (they both exist)


### Both mistakes are detected by the sanity check.
### The first mistake is detected since a podSelector is empty

### To execute from command line:
### python nca.py --sanity tests/example_policies/demo_short/sanity1-networkpolicy.yaml  --base_np_list tests/example_policies/testcase3/testcase3-networkpolicy1.yaml --ns_list tests/example_podlist/ns_list.json  --pod
#_list tests/example_podlist/pods_list.json
