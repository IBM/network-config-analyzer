# Two cases in which forbids can detect problems are demonstrated:
# 1. A network policy enables communication between all the pods of a certain application, cnc-evaluation-service
#    forbids is used to verify that this does not open communication to certain namespaces that should not involve the application and for which communication in non-desirable,
#    and also to the outside world.
#    The check reveals that by mistake communication was left open to the outside world
# 2. It is verified for a certain network policy that communication through certain unsecured ports is forbidden.
#    the check reveals that in the network policy above these ports were not blacklistsed.
