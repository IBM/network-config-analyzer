### The policy has a mistake - and actually it allows all, not as intended and as explained below
### The mistake is that [] selects all pods; the source of the mistake is that right after ingress/egress [] means "select nothing"
### This mistake was revealed by our redundancy check


### namespace default contains (only) pods with app=skydive (only), some with tier=agent and some with tier=analyzer  
### Communication is allowed within the namespace only from tier=analyzer to tier=agent (and app=skydive in both from and to)

#### This policy isolates pods of namespace=default with app=skydive, and within the namespace (default) allows all incoming traffic (ingress) while denying all outgoing traffic (egress)
